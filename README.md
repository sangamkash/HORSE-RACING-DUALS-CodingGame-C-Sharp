# HORSE-RACING-DUALS-CodingGame-c-
Casablanca’s hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. 
During a dual, only two horses will participate in the race. In order for the race to be interesting,
it is necessary to try to select two horses with similar strength.  
Write a program which, using a given number of strengths, identifies the two closest strengths and shows their difference with an integer (≥ 0).
